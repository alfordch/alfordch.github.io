# livefromthedungeon.net

livefromthedungeon.net and its update scripts are DJ Double Two's personal project to archive and host the recordings and website for Live from the Dungeon. 

Update scripts are not included in this repository, but are available upon request.

## About:

These pages are intended to provide access to archives and playlists for Live from the Dungeon,
a radio program aired Fridays from 10PM - 11PM on WCBN 88.3 FM in Ann Arbor, MI. 

Hosted by DJ Double Two, Live from the Dungeon is a Hip-Hop show, with a focus on older styles like
Boom-Bap and Jazz-Rap. Tracks played for the show are from my personal vinyl/CD collection as well as
the WCBN music library. The time frame of the shows airing allows me to provide an explicit broadcast
for your listening experience. 

Live from the Dungeon's first season on air was the summer of 2022. To date, the only season off air
since its premiere was summer 2023. As host, I attempt to plan themed shows for every weekly broadcast,
be sure to check the home page for each week's theme.
