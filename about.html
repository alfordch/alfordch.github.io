            About the show:
            </h1>
            
            <p>
            These pages are intended to provide access to archives and playlists for Live from the Dungeon,
            a radio program aired XXXdays from XXPM - XXPM on WCBN 88.3 FM in Ann Arbor, MI. <br>
            <br>
            Hosted by DJ Double Two, Live from the Dungeon is a Hip-Hop show, with a focus on older styles like
            Boom-Bap and Jazz-Rap. Tracks played for the show are from my personal vinyl/CD collection as well as
            the WCBN music library. The time frame of the shows airing allows me to provide an explicit broadcast
            for your listening experience. <br>
            <br>
            Live from the Dungeon's first season on air was the summer of 2022. To date, the only season off air
            since its premiere was summer 2023. As host, I attempt to plan themed shows for every weekly broadcast,
            be sure to check the home page for each week's theme. <br>
            </p>

            <h2>
            Who is DJ Double Two?:
            </h2>
            <p>
            DJ Double Two is an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan's college of engineering, a huge
            Hip-Hop nerd, and a music collector. I stopped exactly counting how many records/CDs/cassettes I owned and
            left that burden up to Discogs. If you ever, for some odd reason, want to see my entire collection, my Discogs
            profile is linked at the bottom of the page. The truth of the origin of this show is that I needed an excuse
            to play all of this physical music that I own. <br>
            <br>
            On air, I try to stay true to my love for classic Hip-Hop and provide hours of my favorite music ever.
